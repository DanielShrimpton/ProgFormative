The vast majority of the ways in which we teach and learn have been touched by the hands of computer science.
Think about the classrooms that have ditched old chalkboards and whiteboards for a more modern approach, one
that is centered around technology and forward-thinking. The Internet allows us to answer all of our questions
and more, in just milliseconds from us requesting the information. We live in an era that breaks records every
day; never before in history has information been available this freely.

E-learning classes are allowing more and more people to have access to a higher level of education than would
ever be available to them, which is all thanks to the developments in computer science. We have new tools at
our disposal, which enable us to learn in ways that weren't possible even just ten years ago. Sharing information
with our peers has never been easier - with the introduction of 'cloud' storage spaces, we can upload all kinds
of information freely whenever we like, and allow others to access it whenever they like.
